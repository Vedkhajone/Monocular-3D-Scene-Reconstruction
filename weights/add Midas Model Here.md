### Setup 

1) Pick one or more models and download the corresponding weights to the `weights` folder:

MiDaS 3.1
- For highest quality: [dpt_beit_large_512](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v3_1/dpt_beit_large_512.pt)
- For moderately less quality, but better speed-performance trade-off: [dpt_swin2_large_384](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v3_1/dpt_swin2_large_384.pt)
- For embedded devices: [dpt_swin2_tiny_256](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v3_1/dpt_swin2_tiny_256.pt), [dpt_levit_224](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v3_1/dpt_levit_224.pt)
- For inference on Intel CPUs, OpenVINO may be used for the small legacy model: openvino_midas_v21_small [.xml](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v3_1/openvino_midas_v21_small_256.xml), [.bin](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v3_1/openvino_midas_v21_small_256.bin)

MiDaS 3.0: Legacy transformer models [dpt_large_384](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v3/dpt_large_384.pt) and [dpt_hybrid_384](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v3/dpt_hybrid_384.pt)

MiDaS 2.1: Legacy convolutional models [midas_v21_384](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v2_1/midas_v21_384.pt) and [midas_v21_small_256](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS/releases/download/v2_1/midas_v21_small_256.pt)
